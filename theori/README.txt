## Notes
- Light theme contrast has been rebalanced (badges, chips, table, surfaces).
- Subtle animations added (ambient background, floating mark, hover micro-interactions).
- Includes: paper/Theori_paradox.docx (latest) and paper/Theori-v2.docx (archive)


## v5 Notes
- Light theme rebuilt from scratch using token-based colors (no dark translucency leftovers).
- All major components in light mode are driven by CSS variables/overrides.
